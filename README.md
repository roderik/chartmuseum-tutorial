# Chartmuseum Mirror

Since the stable and incubation helm chart repositories are deprecated, charts are published in a multitude of locations. Unfortunately not all these locations are as stable as you would expect them to be. In this post we will setup Chartmuseum on a Kubernetes cluster, backed by AWS S3 and use it and Github Actions to publish our own charts and mirror the repositoreis we need.
